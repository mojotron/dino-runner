# Dino Runner

Goal of this project is learning how to make basic arcade game. Until now I made projects with mostly static DOM elements. Chromes T-Rex game looked as a perfect fit for learning dynamic DOM element interaction and intersection. With a simple design and game mechanics makes it perfect to wrap my brain around game design.

My strategy for making clone of this game was simple. Find tutorial, listen the tutorial without looking at the code. Try to build parts of the game with a general ideas from tutorial. Make pseudo code, translate pseudo code to code. An if I get stuck, experiment, google around but without "seeing" end result. When I make working code, watch that part of the tutorial and refactor my code. This way I'll understand ideas and logic behind game making process.

## How to play

Try [Dino runner](https://mojotron.github.io/dino-runner/), game hosted via Github Pages.

Goal of the game is to jump over cacti. To jump press "Space" key on the keyboard. If the dino collide with cactus game is over. Game is won if you get to the score of 999.

## What have I learned

- Making arcade games is lot of fun. And its not hard as it looks.
- Better understating of timers and intervals.
- Finally getting how to use closure. I moved global variables to the specific view to be used as a closure. Example, using position variable inside GroundsView. Originally this was global variable in model state.
